 * A non-dominated population using an &epsilon;-box dominance comparator.

 * properties, such as guaranteed convergence and diversity if certain other 
 * conditions hold [1].  In addition, this archive also tracks 
 * &epsilon;-progress [2] by counting the number of &epsilon;-box improvements.
